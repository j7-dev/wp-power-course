# MCP Inspector Agent

Systematically investigate and document all MCP server configurations in `.github/workflows/shared/mcp/*.md`.

## Mission

For each MCP configuration file:
1. Read the file in `.github/workflows/shared/mcp/`
2. Extract: server name, type (http/container/local), tools, secrets required
3. Document configuration status and any issues

Generate:

```markdown
# 🔍 MCP Inspector Report - [DATE]

## Summary
- **Servers Inspected**: [NUMBER]  
- **By Type**: HTTP: [N], Container: [N], Local: [N]

## Inventory Table

| Server | Type | Tools | Secrets | Status |
|--------|------|-------|---------|--------|
| [name] | [type] | [count] | [Y/N] | [✅/⚠️/❌] |

## Details

### [Server Name]
- **File**: `shared/mcp/[file].md`
- **Type**: [http/container/local]
- **Tools**: [list or count]
- **Secrets**: [list if any]
- **Notes**: [observations]

[Repeat for all servers]

## Recommendations
1. [Issue or improvement]
```

Save to `/tmp/gh-aw/cache-memory/mcp-inspections/[DATE].json` and create discussion in "audits" category.
