# Power Course MCP Server — Setup Guide

[繁體中文](./mcp.zh-TW.md) | English

> Connect AI agents (Claude Code, Cursor, GPT, etc.) to your WordPress LMS via the [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/).

---

## Overview

Power Course exposes an MCP server that lets AI agents programmatically manage your LMS — creating courses, enrolling students, querying reports, and more — all through a standardized tool interface.

Once connected, you can interact with your WordPress site using natural language:

- "List all courses on example.com, sorted by sales"
- "Enroll user #42 into the Advanced TypeScript course"
- "Create a new chapter in Course #123, topic: AI Marketing in the Modern Age — you arrange the content"
- "Export the student list for Course #101 as CSV"

The AI client translates your request into the appropriate MCP tool calls behind the scenes.

## Prerequisites

### WordPress User

You need a WordPress account with **`manage_woocommerce`** capability (typically an Administrator or Shop Manager role).

---

## Setup Steps

### Step 1 — Generate an Application Password

1. Go to **WordPress Admin → Users → Profile**
2. Scroll down to the **Application Passwords** section
3. Enter a name (e.g. `Claude Code`) and click **Add New Application Password**
4. **Copy the generated password immediately** — it is shown only once

> **Tip**: Application Passwords are built into WordPress (5.6+). No extra plugin is needed.

### Step 2 — Encode Your Credentials

Combine your WordPress username and application password, then Base64-encode the string:

```
username:xxxx xxxx xxxx xxxx xxxx xxxx
```

You can encode it using the command line:

```bash
echo -n "admin:ABCD 1234 EFGH 5678 IJKL 9012" | base64
```

Or visit [https://www.base64encode.org/](https://www.base64encode.org/) and enter `admin:ABCD 1234 EFGH 5678 IJKL 9012`

This outputs something like: `YWRtaW46QUJDRCAxMjM0IEVGR0ggNTY3OCBJSktMIDkwMTI=`

### Step 3 — Configure Your AI Client

Add the MCP server to your AI client's configuration.

#### Claude Code

MCP configuration supports three scopes — pick one:

**Option A — Project-shared** (recommended for teams): add to `.mcp.json` in your project root

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "power-course": {
      "type": "http",
      "url": "https://yoursite.com/wp-json/power-course/v2/mcp",
      "headers": {
        "Authorization": "Basic YWRtaW46QUJDRCAxMjM0IEVGR0ggNTY3OCBJSktMIDkwMTI="
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**Option B — Personal global** (recommended for personal use): add to `~/.claude.json`

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "power-course": {
      "type": "http",
      "url": "https://yoursite.com/wp-json/power-course/v2/mcp",
      "headers": {
        "Authorization": "Basic YWRtaW46QUJDRCAxMjM0IEVGR0ggNTY3OCBJSktMIDkwMTI="
      }
    }
  }
}
```

> **Note**: MCP is **read-only by default**. To allow write/delete operations, log in to **WordPress Admin → Power Course → Settings → AI** and turn on the *Allow update* / *Allow delete* switches. (Issue #217: previously controlled by `ALLOW_UPDATE` / `ALLOW_DELETE` env vars; those are no longer read.)

**Option C — CLI quick setup**:

```bash
claude mcp add --transport http power-course \
  https://yoursite.com/wp-json/power-course/v2/mcp \
  --header "Authorization: Basic YWRtaW46QUJDRCAxMjM0IEVGR0ggNTY3OCBJSktMIDkwMTI="
```

#### Cursor

Add to `.cursor/mcp.json` in your project root:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "power-course": {
      "type": "http",
      "url": "https://yoursite.com/wp-json/power-course/v2/mcp",
      "headers": {
        "Authorization": "Basic YWRtaW46QUJDRCAxMjM0IEVGR0ggNTY3OCBJSktMIDkwMTI="
      }
    }
  }
}
```

#### WP-CLI (STDIO Transport)

If you have WP-CLI access on the server, you can use STDIO transport instead of HTTP:

```bash
# List all registered MCP servers
wp mcp-adapter list

# Start the Power Course MCP server
wp mcp-adapter serve --server=power-course-mcp --user=admin
```

### Step 5 — Verify the Connection

Ask your AI client to list courses:

> "List all published courses on this site"

If the connection is working, you'll get a structured response with your course data.

## Settings

Configure at **Power Course → Settings → MCP** (server / categories / tokens / activity) and **Power Course → Settings → AI** (write/delete permissions), or via REST API.

| Setting | Default | Description |
|---------|---------|-------------|
| `enabled` | `false` | Global MCP server on/off |
| `enabled_categories` | `[]` (all) | Active tool categories — empty array means all tools enabled |
| `rate_limit_per_min` | `60` | Max requests per minute |
| `allow_update` | `false` | **Issue #217.** Allow AI to create/update/sort/duplicate via MCP |
| `allow_delete` | `false` | **Issue #217.** Allow AI to delete/remove/reset via MCP |

---

## Operation-Level Permission Control (Settings → AI)

MCP is **read-only by default**. To allow AI to write or delete data, log in to:

> **WordPress Admin → Power Course → Settings → AI**

Toggle the two switches:

| Switch | Effect |
|--------|--------|
| **Allow update** | Enables create / update / sort / toggle / duplicate / assign / add / mark / grant operations |
| **Allow delete** | Enables delete / remove / reset operations |
| Both off (default) | **Read-only mode**: only list / get / export / stats / count tools are available |

> **Migration note (Issue #217)**: prior versions controlled this via the `ALLOW_UPDATE` / `ALLOW_DELETE` environment variables. **Those env vars are no longer read** — please configure via the AI Tab in WordPress Admin instead. After upgrading, both switches default to `false`; nothing is silently authorised.

### Operation Type Classification

Each MCP tool is automatically classified by its function:

| Operation Type | Tool Name Pattern | Examples |
|----------------|-------------------|----------|
| **read** | `*_list`, `*_get`, `*_export_*`, `*_stats`, `*_count` | `course_list`, `student_get`, `report_revenue_stats` |
| **update** | `*_create`, `*_update`, `*_sort`, `*_toggle_*`, `*_duplicate`, `*_set_*`, `*_assign_*`, `*_add_*`, `*_mark_*`, `*_grant_*` | `course_create`, `chapter_sort`, `student_add_to_course`, `chapter_toggle_finish` |
| **delete** | `*_delete`, `*_remove_*`, `*_reset` | `course_delete`, `student_remove_from_course`, `progress_reset` |

### Error Response

When an AI agent attempts an unauthorised operation, it receives a 403 error with a clear message pointing to the AI Tab:

```
Operation "delete" is disabled for MCP tool "course_delete".
Please enable "Allow delete" in WordPress Admin → Power Course → Settings → AI.
```

---

## Security

- All MCP tools enforce WordPress capability checks (`manage_woocommerce` by default)
- The `allow_update` / `allow_delete` switches in Settings → AI provide operation-level access control (read-only by default)
- Token authentication uses SHA-256 hashed storage — plaintext is shown only at creation
- Each token supports a JSON `capabilities` field to restrict which tools it can access
- Activity logging tracks every tool invocation with 30-day automatic cleanup via `wp_cron`
- Dangerous operations (e.g., `progress_reset`) require an explicit `confirm = true` parameter

---

## Management REST API

Base URL: `{site_url}/wp-json/power-course/v2/`

All endpoints require `manage_options` capability.

| Endpoint | Method | Description |
|----------|--------|-------------|
| `mcp/settings` | GET | Get MCP settings (incl. `allow_update` / `allow_delete`) |
| `mcp/settings` | POST | Update MCP settings (PATCH semantics — only fields sent are updated) |
| `mcp/tokens` | GET | List API tokens (hashed, no plaintext) |
| `mcp/tokens` | POST | Create new token (returns plaintext once) |
| `mcp/tokens/{id}` | DELETE | Revoke a token |
| `mcp/activity` | GET | Query tool activity logs (filterable by `tool_name`, paginated) |

---

## Troubleshooting

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| 401 Unauthorized | Check that your Base64 credentials are correct and the WordPress user exists |
| 403 Forbidden (capability) | Ensure the user has `manage_woocommerce` capability |
| 403 "Operation not allowed" | Open WordPress Admin → Power Course → Settings → AI and turn on *Allow update* and/or *Allow delete* |
| Tools not showing up | Verify MCP server is enabled and the tool category is active in Settings → MCP |
| Connection timeout | Check that the site URL is publicly accessible; use STDIO for localhost |
| `localhost` not working | Use a tunnel (ngrok, Cloudflare Tunnel) or switch to WP-CLI STDIO transport |
